# Electricity Theft Detection Using ML

Electricity theft is a significant problem in the energy sector, causing financial losses for utility companies and posing safety risks. Traditional methods for detecting electricity theft have limitations in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In recent years, the integration of machine learning techniques has shown promise in improving the detection of electricity theft. In this project, we explore the application of machine learning algorithms for detecting electricity theft in smart grid data. Our objective is to identify the most effective algorithm among these three models. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and ensure compatibility with the chosen machine learning algorithms. We performed an extensive evaluation of **SVM, KNN, and CNN** on the dataset. Each algorithm was trained, validated, and tested using appropriate methodologies. We assessed their performance using key metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score** to determine their effectiveness in detecting electricity theft. Our findings reveal that CNN outperformed SVM and KNN in terms of overall detection accuracy and robustness. CNN's ability to automatically learn and extract relevant features from the smart grid data played a crucial role in its superior performance. This project contributes to the field of electricity theft detection by highlighting the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms, particularly CNN, in improving the detection accuracy and reliability. The results emphasize the importance of leveraging advanced techniques to combat electricity theft, thereby enabling utility companies to mitigate financial losses and enhance grid security. The findings of this project have implications for the energy sector, policymakers, and researchers working in the domain of smart grid security. By implementing the identified best-performing algorithm, utility companies can enhance their ability to detect and prevent electricity theft, resulting in improved operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.


In this project, we investigated the application of machine learning algorithms, including **Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, for the detection of electricity theft in smart grid data. The objective was to identify the most effective algorithm for detecting theft users. We evaluated the algorithms using different train:test ratios and analyzed their performance based on **accuracy, Area Under the Curve (AUC), and training time**.

Our findings indicate that CNN outperformed SVM and KNN in both **train:test ratio scenarios (80:20 and 60:40)** for electricity theft detection. The **accuracy is 91.22 % and AUC is 0.7914**, these values were consistently higher for **CNN** compared to the other models. Moreover, the **training time is  30 minutes 45 sec, which was significantly lower for CNN**, suggesting its efficiency in training on the given dataset.

Furthermore, we employed various **data preprocessing techniques, such as data interpolation, the three sigma rule of thumb, and min-max scaling, to handle missing values and normalize the data**. These preprocessing steps were crucial in improving the quality of the dataset and enhancing the performance of the machine learning models.
